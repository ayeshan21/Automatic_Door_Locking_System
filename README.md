# Automatic_Door_Locking_System

Overview
This project is an Arduino-based Door Locking System that enhances security by using an electronic lock mechanism. It likely integrates with components such as a keypad, RFID, servo motor, or biometric sensor to control access.

Features
Secure door locking and unlocking mechanism
Uses Arduino microcontroller
Possible integration with RFID, Keypad, or Fingerprint sensor
LCD display for feedback
Buzzer for alerts
Low power consumption

Hardware Requirements
Arduino Board (e.g., Uno, Mega, Nano)
Servo Motor / Solenoid Lock
Keypad / RFID Module / Fingerprint Sensor (depending on implementation)
LCD Display (optional)
Buzzer (for alerts)
Power Supply
Jumper Wires & Breadboard

Software Requirements
Arduino IDE
Required Arduino Libraries (e.g., Servo, Keypad, MFRC522 for RFID, Adafruit Fingerprint Library, etc.)
